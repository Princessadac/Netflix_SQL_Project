### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Categorize the content based on the presence of the keywords 'kill' and 'wiolence in the description field. Label content containing these keywords as 'Bad_content' and all other content as 'Good_content'. Count how many items fall into each category.
```sql
WITH new_table AS (
    SELECT *,
           CASE
           WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Bad_content'
           ELSE 'Good_content'
